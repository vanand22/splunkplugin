# Splunk REST API Modular Input

2.0.9
-----
* robustified the logic to determine the Splunk management port value

2.0.8
-----
* in some rare circumstances , and only on Windows , there may be permission errors rolling log files when you have configured multiple stanzas.Added a patch to uniquely name log files on a per stanza basis.

2.0.7
-----
* for OAuth2 refresh_token flows , you can now configure if the client_id/client_secret is sent in the Base64 encoded  Basic Authentication header (default) or in the request body. Previous versions of the App put the client_id/client_secret in BOTH the header and request body.

2.0.6
-----
* some code checks to catch null passwords in environments with passwords.conf files that can't be decrypted

2.0.5
-----
* option to use the default bundled "certifi" CA Bundle rather than having to declare your own path to a CA Bundle

2.0.4
-----
* upgraded the Splunk Python SDK to v 1.6.18 to meet the latest App Inspect/Cloud Vetting rules.

2.0.3
-----
* by default ,for refresh_token flows, the client_id and client_secret will get placed as parameters in the request body. Added some code so that the client_id and client_secret will also be included as a Base64 encoded Basic Auth header , https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/refreshing-access-tokens/
                       
2.0.2

1.9.8
-----
* increase page size from 30 to unlimited for the list of encrypted keys.

1.9.7
-----
* updated the custom response handler method signature.Added in backwards compatibility for your existing custom response handlers , or you can update your handlers to use the new `call` method signature. Refer to `rest_ta/bin/responsehandlers.py` for examples.

-----
* logging enhancements for default requests messages

1.9.2
-----
* enforced Python3 for execution of the modular input script.If you require Python2.7 , then download a prior version (such as 1.9.1).

* python3 compatibility tweaks.

1.9
-----
* general appinspect tidy ups
* removed setup.xml and replaced with a custom JS/HTML dashboard for app setup

1.8.3
-----
* bundled in python modules that are not packaged into Splunk versions pre 8 : urlib3 , certifi , chardet , idna

1.8.2
-----
* updated the bundled version of the requests library to version 2.23.0
* stateful variables/settings used to get persisted back to inputs.conf , now they get persisted to a custom config file reststate.conf , which should solve any unwanted auto restarting of the app by splunkd.
* made error logging more verbose by adding stanza name
* minor tweak to authhandlers.py for python 2/3 dual compatibility

1.8.1
-----

-----
* minor manager xml ui tweak for 7.1

1.5.1
-----
* Corrected a build bug with responsehandlers

1.5
-----
* Added an activation key requirement , visit http://www.baboonbones.com/#activation to obtain a non-expiring key

* Docs updated
* Splunk 7.1 compatible

1.4
----
* Delimiter fix

1.3.9
-----
* Can now declare a CRON pattern for your polling interval.
* Multiple requests spawned by tokenization can be declared to run in parallel or sequentially.
* Multiple sequential requests can optionally have a stagger time enforced between each request.

1.3.8
-----
* Minor code bug with logging

1.3.7
-----
* Added support for token replacement functions in the URL to be able to return a list
of values, that will cause multiple URL's to be formed and the requests for these
URL's will be executed in parallel in multiple threads. See tokens.py

1.3.6
-----

* Added a custom response handler for rolling out generic JSON arrays
* Refactored key=value delimited string handling to only split on the first "=" delimiter

1.3.5
-----

* Ensure that token substitution in the endpoint URL is dynamically applied for each
HTTP request

1.3.4
-----

* Added support for dynamic token substitution in the endpoint URL  
  
ie : /someurl/foo/$sometoken$/goo  
  
$sometoken$ will get substituted with the output of the 'sometoken' function
in bin/tokens.py  

1.3.3
-----
* Added support to persist and retrieve cookies

1.3.2
-----
* Changed the logic for persistence of state back to inputs.conf to occur directly after polling/event indexing has completed rather than waiting for the polling loop frequency sleep period to exit. This potentially deals with situations where you might terminate Splunk before the REST Mod Input has persisted state changes back to inputs.conf because it was in a sleep loop during shutdown.
